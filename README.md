# ICASSP 2024 Audio Deep Packet Loss Concealment Grand Challenge

For the 2022 challenge, see below.

Data downloads
* The validation data for the 2024 edition of the challenge has now been released: https://plcchallenge2024pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/plcchallenge24_val_v2.zip
* A tool to check and validate processing latency can be found here: https://plcchallenge2024pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/latency_test_v2.zip
* The blind set has now been released, and can be found here: https://plcchallenge2024pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/plc_challenge_2024_blind_release.zip

We recommend using the recently released new version of PLCMOS, which is part of the speechmos Â· PyPI(opens in new tab) package, to aid with development.

## PLC-MOS

To help with model development, we will provide access to a prototype PLC-MOS neural model API which will provide MOS score estimates for audio files with packet loss concealment applied.
For further details on how to get access to this API, refer to https://aka.ms/plc_challenge . You can find an API usage example in [PLC-MOS-API-Example.ipynb](PLC-MOS-API-Example.ipynb) .
