## Dataset

The training and validation dataset has now been released and is available as a tar.gz archive:

[https://plcchallenge2022pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/test_train.tar.gz](https://plcchallenge2022pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/test_train.tar.gz)

The blind set is now also available:

[https://plcchallenge2022pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/blind.tar.gz](https://plcchallenge2022pub.blob.core.windows.net/plcchallengearchive/blind.tar.gz)

Please make sure to submit your results by the deadline, March 8th 2022 23:59 AoE.

Additional information about the data included can be found in [our challenge paper](INTERSPEECH_2022_Deep_PLC_Challenge.pdf), and information about how to register for the challenge can be found at https://aka.ms/plc_challenge .

## PLC-MOS

To help with model development, we will provide access to a prototype PLC-MOS neural model API which will provide MOS score estimates for audio files with packet loss concealment applied.
For further details on how to get access to this API, refer to https://aka.ms/plc_challenge . You can find an API usage example in [PLC-MOS-API-Example.ipynb](PLC-MOS-API-Example.ipynb) .
